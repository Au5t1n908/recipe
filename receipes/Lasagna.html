        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 mintues.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, prehead the over to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a sppon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to coat it.  Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.  Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzerella cheese.  Repeat layers once more using the remaining noddles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella.  Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the over and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
